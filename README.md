# Project Configuration
This project uses .gitignore to exclude:
- Compiled files (*.class, *.jar) - these are generated and shouldn't be version controlled
- Maven target/ directory - contains build artifacts that can be regenerated
- IDE and OS files - these are user-specific and would cause conflicts
